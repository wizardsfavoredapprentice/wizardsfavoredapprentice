#### (I'm a minor)


### When I am on ponytown I am typically watching youtube or doing something else, but 80% of the time I am available to respond. I likely wont verbally unless I think you are wanting to have a conversation ! 🐇
#### I'm not at all uncomfortable with u coming up to me and just sitting there lol, don't feel forced to talk!
How to tell if I can respond? My activity status!

Online (green icon) = Here! / Busy (red icon) = I'm available, just doing something / Away (the moon icon) = Not there!

I usually play on ipad though which is.. easy for me to disconnect if im doing sumn.
